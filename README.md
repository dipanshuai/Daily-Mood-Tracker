mood list section

at mood select section, give only six emoji with circle view and mood name. and on click of any emoji circle, show a popup with Selected mood, enter reason, and set current mood button.


just at the beginning of mood list section, one button saying today to show the listings of today, there will be another view other day button which will pop the calendar up to select the desired date and day. Future date will not be selected. If some date has no data, then it will show a error saying no entries registered. at the end of calendar popup, there will be a button called view your mood, and on click of that popup, it should show the mood listing of the selected date.

just before the mood listing, create a calculation section where it will show that, how much time was the person in specific mood... like you were happy : time, sad: total sad time, angry, total angry time and so on. 








after heading, add a line asking user to select your current mood. 

In the user input popup, instead of happy, say, You are "selected Mood" now. and before input field, instead of "what's the reason" ... add Why are you "selected mood"... Enter the reason.

Add a third button in mood list section, which will display none to the listing container div, show a calendar, and on each calendar date, show the most recorded/occured feeling happened on that date. if clicked on any of the date, it should bring back the listing container with listing ofthat day.
